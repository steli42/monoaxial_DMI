observations: 

for a small system like 7x7, we can stabilise a skyrmion for alpha = 1

for alpha cca <=0.5, the skyrmion and antiskyrmion states have non-trivial overlap and at alpha = 0 they 
become the same state with overlap =1, as is expected for the plateau

Actually, when looking at them, for alpha <= 0.5, they dont resemble skyrmions at all anymore!!

this is not the case for systems which are larger like 15x15 where skyrmions stay being skyrmions but we get the plateaus 

the plateau is more and more prominent with increasing L, for a 7x7 it is invisible basically...
but we can still notice that the states look like they belong to a plateau
